# Serverless Node.js Starter

A Serverless starter that adds ES7 syntax, serverless-offline, linting, environment variables, and unit test support. Part of the [Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) guide.

[Serverless Node.js Starter](https://github.com/linerocks/serverless-nodejs-starter) uses the [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) plugin (an extension of the [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) plugin) and the [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) plugin. It supports:

- **Generating optimized Lambda packages with Webpack**
- **Use ES7 syntax in your handler functions**
  - Use `import` and `export`
- **Run API Gateway locally**
  - Use `serverless offline start`
- **Support for unit tests**
  - Run `npm test` to run your tests
- **Sourcemaps for proper error messages**
  - Error message show the correct line numbers
  - Works in production with CloudWatch
- **Lint your code with ESLint**
- **Add environment variables for your stages**
- **No need to manage Webpack or Babel configs**
- **Built in responses function**

### Hello world!

Here is the ES7 source for lambda's hello worlds:

``` javascript
import response from '../libs/response'

export const handler = async (event, context) => {
  return response.success({
    message: `Go Serverless v1.0! ${(await message({ time: 1, copy: 'Your function executed successfully!' }))}`
  })
}

const message = ({ time, ...rest }) => new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(`${rest.copy} (with a delay)`)
  }, time * 1000)
)
```

### Requirements

- [Install the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
- [Configure your AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

### Installation

To create a new Serverless project.

``` bash
$ serverless install --url https://github.com/linerocks/serverless-nodejs-starter --name my-project
```

Enter the new directory

``` bash
$ cd my-project
```

Install the Node.js packages

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

To run a function on your local

``` bash
$ serverless invoke local --function hello
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

``` bash
$ serverless offline start
```

Deploy your project

``` bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

``` bash
$ serverless deploy function --function hello
```

#### Running Tests

Run your tests using

``` bash
$ npm test
```

We use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).

#### Environment Variables

To add environment variables to your project

1. Rename `env.example` to `.env`.
2. Add environment variables for your local stage to `.env`.
3. Uncomment `environment:` block in the `serverless.yml` and reference the environment variable as `${env:MY_ENV_VAR}`. Where `MY_ENV_VAR` is added to your `.env` file.
4. Make sure to not commit your `.env`.

#### Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint your code via the [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) plugin.

You can turn this off by adding the following to your `serverless.yml`.

``` yaml
custom:
  bundle:
    linting: false
```

To [override the default config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring), add a `.eslintrc.json` file. To ignore ESLint for specific files, add it to a `.eslintignore` file.
